# Oh that's cool!

I'm [Tyler Williams](https://coolsoftware.dev/) (he/him). I'm a senior software engineer at [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red/). If you're looking for special expertise in all things React Native, [hit us up](https://infinite.red/contact).

I'm also one of the core maintainers of [MobX-State-Tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree).

I love TypeScript, React, React Native, and local-first data architecture for mobile applications. I have a Master's in Software Engineering from Regis University, but the most important education I've ever received has come from contributing to open source (it's what I loved about working at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)).

In my spare time (what little I have), I write about software over at [my blog](https://coolsoftware.dev/blog).

I'm always happy to talk shop. Send me an email or Tweet at me!
