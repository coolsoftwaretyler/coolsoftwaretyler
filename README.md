# Cool!

I'm [Tyler Williams](https://coolsoftware.dev/) (he/him). I'm a software engineer and I'm one of the core maintainers of [MobX-State-Tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree).

I'm seeking sponsorships to support and sustain my open source work (about 10 hours per week).

My primary focus with MobX-State-Tree is to improve runtime performance, modernize our TypeScript implementation, and revamp our docs to be more specific and helpful.
